<div id="pageBody"><p>This is the latest verion of my QSlim software
   package.  The core of the system remains largely the same as in 
   <a href="http://mgarland.org/software/qslim20.html">Version 2.0</a>.
   However, some features have been updated and some bugs have been fixed.
   Notable changes in this release include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     A new cross-platform GUI based on <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>.
 </li>

 <li>
     Some of the core MixKit code has been 
     replaced by <a href="http://mgarland.org/software/libgfx.html">libgfx</a> library.
 </li>

 <li>
     Compiles with modern compilers (e.g., GCC 3.x).
 </li>
</ul>
<p>This
   software is <em>not</em> public domain.
   Please read the 
   <a href="http://mgarland.org/dist/qslim21-license.txt">licenses</a>
   for the MixKit library, which covers the
   majority of the simplification code, and the
   SlimKit package, which covers the set of programs using the MixKit library.

   licenses are available online.
</p>
<p>The immediate motivation for releasing it was that version 2.0 no longer
   compiled with GCC 3.x compilers.  This version compiles correctly on
   modern platforms &#8212; I&#8217;ve personally tried it on current versions of
   Mac OSX, Linux, and
   Cygwin.  However, I haven&#8217;t provided any default build files for Visual
   C++ as I don&#8217;t really use VC++ any more.
</p>
<p>This is the <i>last</i> release of the MixKit software library.  It
   actually contains code that had been laying around on my desktop for a
   quite a while.  I pretty much ceased active development of this code
   base 3&#8211;4 years ago.  However, I would be happy to post any patches that
   I discover or that people send to me.  And while this is the last of the
   MixKit-based versions of QSlim, there may be future QSlim releases based
   on an entirely different code base.
</p>
<p>This
   software contains the bulk of the code I developed in the course
   of my doctoral research at Carnegie Mellon University.  Since I
   developed it for my own research purposes, the code may be a little
   ugly in places, and the selection of features has been largely driven
   by what I needed to get my work done.  It&#8217;s also been a place to toy
   around with experimental features.  However, it&#8217;s proven quite useful
   to me, and I hope you&#8217;ll find it useful as well.
</p>
<p>I am releasing this software in the hope that you&#8217;ll find it useful.
   If you use my software for anything more substantial than toying
   around, I&#8217;d be interested to hear about it.  Any other comments you&#8217;d
   like to make are also welcome.  I&#8217;d also like to encourage you to
   contribute bug reports, patches, and whatever improvements you might
   come up with.  If enough people are actively using this software, I
   may set up a mailing list.  Please send me e-mail if you think this
   would be a useful resource.

<h2>System Overview</h2>
<pre><code>
</code></pre><p>This package contains two components, the MixKit library and the
   SlimKit collection of surface modeling tools.  QSlim is the primary
   application in the SlimKit collection.
</p>
<p>QSlim can be built as both a command-line only &#8216;qslim&#8217; program as well
   as an interactive &#8216;qvis&#8217; program.  Both programs should compile on
   pretty much any Unix system, as well as Windows 9x/NT.  There is no
   support for MacOS, but if someone wants to do the port I&#8217;d very much
   like to have it.
   The interactive program requires OpenGL or <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa</a> and the <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a> GUI
   toolkit.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mgarland.org/research/quadrics.html">details of the algorithms</a>
   used in this software package are available online.  A much more
   authoritative description can be found in my
   <a href="http://mgarland.org/research/thesis.html">Ph.D.  dissertation</a>, which is now available.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>The main distribution contains all the necessary source code.  I am
   also distributing the <a href="http://mgarland.org/research/quadrics.html">sample models</a>
   which appear in the papers I&#8217;ve published about this
   algorithm.
